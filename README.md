# 🚦 Vehicle Intersection Simulation

## 📌 Description
This project simulates vehicle movement through an intersection with different statuses: **approaching**, **waiting**, and **cleared**. The simulation provides a dynamic way to visualize how traffic signals control vehicle movement.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ Displays approaching vehicles 🚗
- ✅ Shows vehicles that are waiting at the intersection ⏳
- ✅ Marks vehicles that have cleared the intersection ✅
- ✅ Interactive buttons to start, stop, and clear the simulation
- ✅ Simple UI with real-time updates
